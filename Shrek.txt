Once upon a time there was a lovely

princess. But she had an enchantment

upon her of a fearful sort which could

only be broken by love's first kiss.

She was locked away in a castle guarded

by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.

Many brave knights had attempted to

free her from this dreadful prison,

but non prevailed. She waited in the

dragon's keep in the highest room of

the tallest tower for her true love

and true love's first kiss. (laughs)

MAN1

thing can do to you?

MAN3

bread.

Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.
